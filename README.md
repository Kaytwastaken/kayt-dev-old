# [Kayt.dev](https://kayt.dev)

### Home to scuffed [blog posts](https://kayt.dev/blog)
Written, stored, and displayed in a custom backend built with Typescript, Prisma, and tears; said blog posts are only the bleeding edge of unreliable, bodged together, and typo-ridden. When I bother to write any they'll contain news of projects im working on, rabbit holes I've fallen down, and other random news that doesnt feel like it would fit in a tumblr post.

(eventually I'll have an RSS feed i swear)


### Eventually my [portfolio](https://kayt.dev/why-did-you-click-this-link-i-said-eventually)
Which will host full-resolution and watermarked uploads of any art im actually proud of, and mayhaps even commission information in some future where I have the time and the audience to explore such a venture.


### And whatever the hell else i might make
Which may include things like shitty JS games, minecraft resource packs, and even minecraft world downloads? Some ideas in the works include:
- reviving my old site, [Game Design By Idiots (gdbidots.com)](http://www.gdbidiots.com)
  - Eventually this would become home to all my games, resourcepacks, world downloads, and possibly any other non-game-related apps
- creating a, or a series of, JavaScript text-based games known as ICEkit, including, but not limited to:
  - the ideal **Idle Collection Explorer kit**
  - an **Idle Command Environment kit**
  - and an **Incredibly Complex Escapism kit**
- Creating a [Vanilla Tweaks](http://vanillatweaks.net/)-esque resourcepack builder for Minecraft by the name of Kaytostrophic Tweaks
- And an art reference board built to be actually useful
